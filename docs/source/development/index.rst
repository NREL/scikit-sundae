The scikit-SUNDAE team welcomes contributions from the community to enhance the functionality and performance of the package. Whether you are fixing bugs, adding new features, or improving documentation, all contributions are valuable. Our goal is to make the development process as seamless as possible by providing clear guidelines and automating many of the common development tasks.

To get started, developers should fork the repository, set up a local development environment, and follow the guidelines for contributing code. We use modern tools and workflows to ensure code quality, including linters, automated tests, and continuous integration checks. Whether you're an experienced developer or just getting started, we encourage collaboration and innovation. Please refer to the specific development guides for detailed steps on setting up your environment, running tests, following the proper branching strategies, and more.
