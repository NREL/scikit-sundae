Welcome to the scikit-SUNDAE user guide, your comprehensive resource for getting started
with and mastering the use of the scikit-SUNDAE package. Whether you're a beginner looking
to learn the basics of numerical integration with SUNDIALS or an experienced user seeking
advanced features, this guide provides a structured path to help you navigate through the
package's capabilities. Here, you'll find detailed explanations of scikit-SUNDAE's core
features, installation instructions, and guidance on solving typical problems using the
package.

In this guide, you'll also learn about the numerical solvers wrapped by scikit-SUNDAE,
including the popular CVODE and IDA solvers, which are used to solve initial value problems
for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and differential-algebraic equations (DAEs),
respectively. We'll walk you through various types of problems these solvers are suited for,
from simple initial value problems to more complex real-world applications.

Beyond the basics, this guide offers in-depth tutorials and practical examples to help you
leverage the package's advanced features. You'll also find descriptions of the solver
configurations and the various options for customizing their behavior to suit your specific
use case. For more technical users, detailed documentation on the linear solvers, event
functions, and Jacobians will ensure you can fully utilize the flexibility of the
package in complex workflows.

Each section is designed to give you the information you need in a straightforward and
accessible format. Explore each section to get the most out of scikit-SUNDAE and start
integrating powerful numerical solvers into your Python projects.
